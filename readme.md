# Let it Glow Maker Advent Calendar 2023

It's the ultimate festive treat for makers of all experience levels, guiding you step-by-step through 12 exciting days of blinky projects including new components to play with every day! Whilst our 12 Projects of Codemas calendar offers a flavour of lots of different types of components (and how to use them), this calendar has a more blinky theme - it's packed with festive LED projects including new fun formats to play with, including coding your own decorative lights!

The first day of the calendar includes a Raspberry Pi Pico H, Micro-USB cable and a couple of breadboards to get you set up (sorry, we had to spoil box #1!), including some introductory code examples, then the following boxes each contain a new project to learn and program with your Pico and lots of popular blinky components - think LEDs, addressable RGB lights, displays and more!

Every other day we provide a fun new way to control your light-up components - think sensors, sliders and more. 

Each day youâ€™ll learn how to make a new Pico project with your box's components via our daily online box guides (published daily from 1st December), with handy wiring diagrams and lots of code examples in MicroPython. Great for learning how to code or building up your selection of blinky components in a fun way!

- Box contents summary
